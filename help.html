            <p>Customization for your personalized scratch-off card is done using the customization panel. This panel can be hidden to preview the changes. Let’s first take a look at the elements of the panel before going through the instructions. 
              Then, you can create the link for your personalized scratch-off card in three easy steps. <strong>Please note: </strong>The customization page does not have a save feature. To avoid losing your progress, complete your personalization in one session. 
              Leaving the browser may erase your changes from the cache

            <p><strong>Step-1:</strong></p><p>1) First select your background image from the dropdown. </p>
            <p>2) Then enter your title. Title is the text that appears at the top with larger font size. It has 25 characters limit.</p>
            <p>3) Choose the font for your title from the dropdown.</p>
            <p>4) Choose the relative font size for your title from the dropdown. You can select "Smaller," "Normal," or "Bigger." However, use this option with caution. While the page is designed to be responsive and work on most common screen sizes, larger fonts may cause certain elements of the scratcher to go off-screen or overlap with other elements on smaller devices.</p>
            <p>5) Enter the text under your title. This text has 50 character limit.</p>
            <p>6) Enter the text to be hidden under the scratch area. This text has 110 characters limit.</p>
            <p>7) Select the shape of the scratch area. Make sure this selection aligns with the foreground you will choose next, as some foregrounds work better with specific shapes. For example, "Gift Package" foregrounds pair better with a square scratch area, while the "Halloween1" foreground is better suited for a circular scratch area.
            </p>
            <p>8) Select the foreground image for the scratch area. This image will cover the text beneath it on the scratch area.</p>

          <p>1) This product requires an internet connection to customize and use. Recipients must have internet access and a JavaScript-enabled browser to view the webpage and scratch the card.</p>
          <p>2) This product supports smartphones, tablets, desktops, and laptops with an internet browser. It is designed to work on most modern devices; however, due to device variability, compatibility cannot be guaranteed on every device. </p>
          <p>3) You must only use latest versions of Safari, Chrome, Edge, Opera or Firefox browser. IE or other browsers aren't supported.</p>
          <p>4) Although it supports landscape mode, it is recommended to use it in Portrait mode on mobile devices.</p>
          <p>5) If you observe too large text and objects on Firefox/Mozilla browser, accessibility option might have been turned on. Disable it as seen in the image below to see the scratcher in original size.</p>

          a) The selected font or font size for the title is too large to fit on the screen.
          b) The title text is too long due to very long words or missing spaces between words and/or after punctuation marks.
          To fix this, you can, select a different font, reduce the font size, ensure there are spaces between words and after 
          punctuation and use shorter words (under 17 characters). See the examples below: In the first example, missing spaces 
          between words cause the title to overflow. After adding spaces, the problem is fixed.</p>

      : This is a warning message. If the font size is too large for the title—especially with certain fonts that appear bigger even at the same 
      point size—the title text may extend beyond the screen or overlap with other elements. To prevent this, the web page performs an automatic check and adjusts the font size as needed to ensure all text remains visible on screen.
      The title font size is gradually reduced automatically. If the issue cannot be resolved through these adjustments, the error described in (1) above will be displayed.
      As a result of this adjustment, your title text may appear smaller than the size you originally selected. If you prefer to avoid this, try choosing a different font.</p>

    this error, you can instead copy the link yourself and share it in your messaging app of choice. In order to copy the link you can either click 
  "Go to the Link" button and copy the link from your browser's address bar or copy the short URL (if you chose this option) displayed in the message box.

            : We use a third-party service to shorten customized links. If you repeatedly request shortened links, 
            create a link shortly after your previous one, or if many users are using the service at the same time, you may encounter 
            this error. Please try again after a few moments. If the error persists, you can cancel the "Shorten URL" option and create your link without shortening it—however, the link will be longer. If you continue to experience this issue after waiting, please contact the shop for assistance. </p>
